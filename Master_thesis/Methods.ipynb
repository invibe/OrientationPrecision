    "For this two-alternative foce choice task, the target used was a static MotionCloud (? ° diameter) that was presented at the centre of the screen, on a grey background. Each trial started with a central fixation cross displayed for 250 ms. Than a fixed-duration 250 ms gap occurred between the offset of the fixation cross and the onset of the static target. The target was then presented in the centre of the screen for 250 ms. Then participant had 500ms to report the pattern’s orientation they perceived using the mouse. If the orientation was clockwise of the vertical, they had to move the mouse to the right; otherwise they had to move it to the left (Figure 1A and figure 1B). For each trial, $B_\\theta$ and $B_sf$ were randomly chosen out of 5 possibilities\n"
