# MSc Internship

Master 2 internship under the supervision of [Laurent Perrinet](https://github.com/laurentperrinet)


## Main objective

Orientation selectivity of neurons in V1 is believed to be central to visual form perception. In many species (especially in mammals), early stages of visual form processing begin with orientation selectives neurons in primary visual cortex (**V1**). V1 neurons that share the same preferred orientation are grouped into *orientation columns*. Cortical cells in a neighbor column will have a slightly different orientation preference, which gradually vary across the surface of the cortex. 

The main objective of this internship is to create a **realistic** model of the primary visual cortex  that will represent these **cortical columns** and the **lateral connections** between them.

## Notebooks

Observations and project's progress  will be documented and presented in the form of a clear and concise technical report (Notebooks). 

They will be posted weekly in the /Notebooks folder
